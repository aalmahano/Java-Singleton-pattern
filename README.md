# Java Singleton pattern

This is a basic example of Singleton pattern, explained as a story.
We have the "ChocolateBox" class, which we can buy a box of filled chocolate. There is also the "Person" class, which we create people who like eating chocolate...
If you want to understand how Singleton pattern works and see how this thriller ends, run the app! ;)
